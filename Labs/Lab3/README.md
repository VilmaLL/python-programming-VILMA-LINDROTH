This folder contains a .py file that reads a file "unlabelled_data.csv", labels the data from a linear classification, plots a graph over the labeled datapoints and writes the data into a new file "labelled_data.csv".

It contains a report.ipynb file that compares several lines for linear classification and discussed the differences between the lines and the potential preferences to use one line over another, as well as the reliability of the classification method.

It also contains the two data files "unlabelled_data.csv" and "labelled_data.csv"

To use this program, the user must download the file "unlabelled_data.csv" to run the code.
